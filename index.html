    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>I think that what’s inside the mystery black box is a smaller box that has a tube at a certain limit, that lets a varying amount of water come out.</p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has a funnel at the top and a pipe at the bottom, jutting outwards. When you pour water into the funnel a certain amount comes out, however, it is not always the same. The data was always varying, sometimes less, sometimes more, sometimes exact. My team thought that there must be a tubing connected to the funnel that let the water go into a box. The box would fill, until it reached a certain point. When it reached that certain point the water would go into another tube that would go into another box. After the second box it would go out into our measuring bowl. However, there could be less water that comes out, an exact measure or even a leakage. We tested our model by putting 500mL of water inside and seeing the outcome. Our first data was an input of 500mL and an output of 0mL.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A model is basically a prototype. It’s a small version of the true completed object. Models help because they can show you what can work or what can’t work, and l3et you present it before you actually invest money to make it. Models also have limitations. They don’t let you see the whole entire object and it might not work as well as the actual form.</li>
        <li>You should believe our claim because it worked the way we wanted it to work. We wanted it to have the same results as the original mystery box. Our first piece of data was an input of 500 and an output of 0 which was what the main mystery box had. This worked because we had a limit of 500 mL of water so that we got 0 mL of water later on. Then in our next test we had less than 500 mL because of that limit. Then it became randomized which was what the mystery box also did.</li>
        <li>I think that what’s inside the mystery black box is a very long tube going down to a smaller box that’s situated at the bottom. This then goes right out into the container outside the box. The outcomes would’ve been different because it would’ve been the exact same outcome each time.</li>
