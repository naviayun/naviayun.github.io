    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I think that whatâ€™s inside the mystery black box is a smaller box that has a tube at a certain limit, that lets a varying amount of water come out.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has a funnel at the top and a pipe at the bottom, jutting outwards. When you pour water into the funnel a certain amount comes out, however, it is not always the same. The data was always varying, sometimes less, sometimes more, sometimes exact. My team thought that there must be a tubing connected to the funnel that let the water go into a box. The box would fill, until it reached a certain point. When it reached that certain point the water would go into another tube that would go into another box. After the second box it would go out into our measuring bowl. However, there could be less water that comes out, an exact measure or even a leakage. We tested our model by putting 500mL of water inside and seeing the outcome. Our first data was an input of 500mL and an output of 0mL.
